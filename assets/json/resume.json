Our analysis reveals a correlation between the geometric properties of token embeddings and the cross-entropy loss of next token predictions, implying that prompts with higher loss values have tokens represented in higher-dimensional spaces."

As a practical application, we leverage persistence similarity to identify and prune redundant layers, demonstrating comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets."

      "summary": "We apply persistent homology to the dark matter halo catalogs, and build a summary statistic for comparison with the joint power spectrum and bispectrum statistic regarding their information content on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. Through a Fisher analysis, we find that constraints from persistent homology are tighter for 8 out of the 10 parameters by margins of 13–50%."
